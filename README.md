# Mission Demolition

## Cooler in a meaningful way
- Two levels where a castle is in the sky. But, it is at the game over screen so the player has to quit or finish the game to play it.
- A retry level button if the walls fall in a way that makes it nearly impossible to get the goal
- A ding sound when the goal is met

## Additional modifications
- A quit button that leads to the game over screen to choose between normal castles and floating castles
- Woosh sound when the projectile is shot
- Rubber band for slingshot
- Game over screen
